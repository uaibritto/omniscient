### Corrections and improvements

- The code snippets for creating components have been improved and divided into two parts:
    - `Components with props`

This ensures the true usefulness of each component, since larger components, such as a card or a page, are incompatible with how props were previously defined.

- Improvements to the documentation to maintain consistency and fidelity with the code snippets.
